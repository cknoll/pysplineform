# General

This module allows to interactively place points in the plane which will be
interpolated by a spline.

This can, e.g., be used to manually describe a geometric path or a time-signal.

This module is based on [matplotlib]() and [scipy](). It is still in very early stage of development.


# Installation

# Usage
Run the script. You can
* Drag points to move them,
* double-click to add a new point,
